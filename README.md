# Core

My very own, personal Win32 core C++20 library.

This library features several classes to automate the creation of native windows and controls. It's a high-performance, very thin layer over the Win32 API.

## Usage

Clone this repo and #include the `.h` you need, which are under the `core` directory. Then include the `.cpp` in your build process.

This library has no dependencies other than the Win32 API itself. It has been tested with MSVC 2019 compiler, with the `/std:c++20` flag.
